# README-Generator

## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. The README is responsible for relaying  what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues and how to contact the owner of the repository.

This application will quickly and dynamically generate a README file by using a command-line application. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.


## Installation
    -Download Node.js to your computer 

    -Through your computer's terminal, first run the command "npm init", 
     followed by "npm install inquirer"

## Usage
In the computer's terminal, run the command "node app" to access the README-generator. Upon doing so, you 
will be prompted with questions regarding your GitHub project and what information you would like to include 
about it. After looping through the required prompts, the generator will dynamically create your README.md file
